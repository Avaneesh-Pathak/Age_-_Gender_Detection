# Age and Gender Detector

The Age and Gender Detector project utilizes computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms to detect faces in images or real-time video streams and predict the gender and age of the individuals. By implementing face detection and analysis algorithms, this project aims to accurately determine the gender and age of a person based on their facial features. This README file provides an overview of the project and instructions for setting up and running the Age and Gender Detector model.

## Introduction

The Age and Gender Detector project focuses on accurately detecting faces in images or video streams and predicting the gender and age of the individuals. By utilizing computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms, the model combines facial feature analysis, image processing, and classification to achieve high accuracy in gender and age prediction.

## Installation

To install and set up the Age and Gender Detector project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the project repository from GitHub:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Avaneesh-Pathak /Age_-_Gender_Detector.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd Age_-_Gender_Detector
   ```
3. Set up a Python virtual environment (recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - For Windows:
     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - For macOS and Linux:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
5. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Follow the steps below to use the Age and Gender Detector model:

1. Ensure that you have activated the Python virtual environment (if applicable).
2. Run the `age_gender_detector.py` script:
   ```
   python Age_-_Gender_Detector.py
   ```
3. The script will either prompt you to provide an image file or use the webcam to capture real-time video frames.
4. The model will detect faces in the image or video frames and predict the gender and age of each individual.
5. The results, including the predicted gender and age for each detected face, will be displayed or saved depending on the script implementation.

## Model Training

The Age and Gender Detector model may require pre-training on a large-scale dataset to accurately predict gender and age. However, if you have specific requirements or want to improve the existing model, you can follow these steps:

1. Prepare a labeled dataset of face images with corresponding gender and age labels.
2. Organize the dataset into training and testing sets.
3. Modify and customize the model training script `train_model.py` to suit your requirements.
4. Run the `train_model.py` script to train the model on your dataset.
5. Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set and make any necessary adjustments to improve accuracy.

## Dataset

The Age and Gender Detector model require a labeled dataset of face images with corresponding gender and age labels. Ensure that your dataset contains a diverse set of face images representing different genders and age ranges to achieve accurate predictions.

If you don't have a dataset, you can utilize publicly available face image datasets or create your own by collecting and labeling face images.

## Results

The Age and Gender Detector model will provide results based on the analysis of the provided image or video frames. The results may include the following:

- Detected faces in the input image or video frames
- Predicted gender (e.g., male, female) for each detected face
- Predicted age range (e.g., young, middle-aged, old) for each detected face

Please review the output carefully and assess the accuracy and reliability of the predictions.
